- index meteors, to allow saving meteor mirroring
- UI for editing world & Game
- add UI to change meteor velocity, angle, and density
- give slight randomness to metal spot arrangements so it doesn't look too perfect?
- give a slight variability in mirrored meteor positions
- optional base perlin noise
- ideally, make all the stuff in meteor.lua independent from interface (UI and I/O). this way it can simply be included as part of the Spring version, rather than reimplemented.
