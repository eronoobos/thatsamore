- don't remove ramps when resizing or moving
- UI for editing world & Game
- add UI to change meteor velocity, angle, and density
- allow multiple metal spots in one meteor, meteor.metal contains the number (to be drawn in a circle around the center at equal angles from each other, with a slight randomness so it doesn't look too perfect)
- give a slight variability in mirrored meteor positions
- optional base perlin noise
- reorganize into
	- meteor (meteor skeleton, only parameters and a seed packet)
	- impact (all render resolution-independent calculations)
		- gets all new noise keys from the meteor's seed packet
	- crater (all render resolution-dependent calculations)
