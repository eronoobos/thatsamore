- change meteor.lua into a module
	- renderer output: collect data within the frame function, and return it when the (new) RendererFrame() function is called. for image files it's return piecemeal, each frame, for other data it's only returned as a 2D table once the renderer is done
- index meteors, to allow saving meteor mirroring
- add UI to change meteor velocity, angle, and density
- give slight randomness to metal spot arrangements so it doesn't look too perfect?
- give a slight variability in mirrored meteor positions
- optional base perlin noise
- ideally, make all the stuff in meteor.lua independent from interface (UI and I/O). this way it can simply be included as part of the Spring version, rather than reimplemented.
- output to 16-bit PNG not PGM
- threading?
