- don't remove ramps when resizing or moving
- UI for editing world & Game
- add UI to change meteor velocity, angle, and density
- allow multiple metal spots in one meteor, meteor.metal contains the number (to be drawn in a circle around the center at equal angles from each other, with a slight randomness so it doesn't look too perfect)
- give a slight variability in mirrored meteor positions
- optional base perlin noise
- reorganize into
	- meteor (meteor skeleton, only parameters and a seed seed)
		- seed seed meaning a seed with which to generate a sequence of random seeds for the impact/crater's perlin noises
	- impact (all render resolution-independent calculations)
		- gets all new noise keys from the meteor's seed packet
	- crater (all render resolution-dependent calculations)
- ideally, make all the stuff in meteor.lua independent from interface (UI and I/O). this way it can simply be included as part of the Spring version, rather than reimplemented.
